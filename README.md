##About
This is a small registration app. This was built using Express.js, Node.js,
Next.js, React.js, MongoDB and Mongoose.

##Functionality
Using NextAuth library, the app allows for Github authorization. Once authorized,
a form will pop up. Using this form, you can:
-Register information about yourself
-Edit that information
-If you have already entered information, it should be saved
-all information is saved on a mongodb cloud database

The app is also responsive to most screen-sizes.

##Inspiration
I owe the following articles a lot in the way of implementing this app:
